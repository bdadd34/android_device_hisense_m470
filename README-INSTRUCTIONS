You do not have to use davepmer's kernel but your kernel must support bck for wifi to work

To build, first copy all .diff to your build root folder and copy toolchain/prebuilt to your root folder/prebuilt
then from your build root in a terminal run the following

patch -p1 < a2dp-fix.diff
patch -p1 < fastaudio.diff
patch -p1 < external-patch.diff
patch -p1 < hardware-patch.diff
